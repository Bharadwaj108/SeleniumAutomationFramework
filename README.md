Reporting  - Extent reports - The report can be found in ...//projectdirectory/BrowserTests/debug/bin/TestReports/
Error Logging - Log4Net - Functionality has been implimented but did not log any errors due to time limitation.
Thread.Sleep has been used due to time limitation. Ideally I would have page and control load utilities using fluent wait.That way the delays are not hard coded.
